![](https://github.com/hyungkwonko/2019-summer-seminar/blob/master/img/img0.png)

This repository will cover projects done through summer 2019 at SNU HCIL. The plan is to take [RL coursework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ4vw6v3LcA&list=PLlMkM4tgfjnKsCWav-Z2F-MMFRx-2gMGG) made by Sung KIM at HKUST for the first five weeks, and then to implement personal work picked from [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Acrobot-v1/) for the last 2 weeks.
